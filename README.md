*Can you survive Mom‚Äôs SUSPICION?*  

---

## Why Mom Interruption?  
**We‚Äôve all been there:**
- You study for **hours**, take a **5-second break**, and *BAM* - Mom assumes you‚Äôve been scrolling all day.  
- Someone "checks in" *just* as you pause to breathe.  
- You need to laugh at the chaos instead of crying into your textbook.
 
**Mom Interruption** turns the *universal fear* of being "caught slacking" into a chaotic simulator. Perfect for anyone who‚Äôs ever panicked at the sound of a door creak

---

## Features  
### 1Ô∏è. **Mom Modes**  
- **Hardcore Mom**: Interrupts more often (like she‚Äôs got a sixth sense).  
- **Chill Mom**: Interrupts less often (gives you a *fighting chance*).

### 2Ô∏è. **Panic Tapping Mini-Game**  
- When Mom barges in, **TAP LIKE YOUR GRADES DEPEND ON IT** to "prove" you were working!  
- **Succeed**: *"Mom‚Äôs suspicion level: 0%"*  
- **Fail**: *"Wi-Fi password changed. Maybe next time."*

### 3. **Share the Chaos**
- **Victory?** Tweet *"I survived 5 Mom interruptions! #MomInterruptionSim"*  
- **Caught?** Post *"Mom caught me after 30 mins‚Ä¶ "*   

---

## How It Works  
1. **Pick Your Mom Mode**: Hardcore or Chill.  
2. **Start the Timer**: Study/work hard.  
3. **Survive Interruptions**:  
   - **Tap frantically** to hide your "break" (even if you weren‚Äôt taking one).  
   - **Fail** = Timer stops. **Win** = Keep your streak alive!  
4. **Flex or Roast Yourself**: Share humorous results.
