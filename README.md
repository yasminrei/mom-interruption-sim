### [Mom Interruption](https://mom-interruption.vercel.app) is a simple countdown timer with a twist... After you start the clock, Mom is constantly checking in on you to make sure you are working/studying/practising!

When you get interrupted, Mom will confront you to which you have to tap multiple times to respond to her interruption! You can either go for Hardcore Mom who interrupts you more frequently, or Chill Mom who interrupts you less frequently.

This app isn‚Äôt about perfect focus, but it's a focus trainer! It‚Äôs about laughing at the chaos of working and studying while training yourself to bounce back from distractions. So many times have I been distracted by one tiny thing - if only there was a way to practise bouncing back from that faster.

You know that feeling where you're studying for hours, and right at the time when you're taking a break for a few minutes, someone walks in on you and assumes you haven't been studying, but have been playing games/scrolling on your phone the entire time? Or when someone is constantly checking on you to make sure you are still doing work? This humorous timer simulates Mom walking in every time you take your study/work breaks and thinking you‚Äôre not working hard enough. 

A [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGEo2Kohb8) by TwoSetViolin can also paint a picture, where they uploaded a video titled "4 Hours of Asian Mum to Help You Focus on Practising/Studying/Working". 

Maybe it's someone else who keeps checking in on you to make sure you are completing work - this app takes the humour from these situations and encapsulates it!

Can you withstand Mom's interruptions and work/study/practise your way to victory?
